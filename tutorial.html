<h2>Introduction and guide assumptions</h2>

This guide is designed for learning basepack which is based on Ruby on Rails framework. So it is necessary that you have a previous experience with Rails. Basepack ties together a collection of gems which are helpful in any application. It really is a well packed Ruby on Rails framework with additional features on top of it. 
So for easy start it is highly recommended that you are familiar with gems below (you have used them at least in one application). These gems are essential part of basepack.
* devise
* cancan
* rails_admin especially rails_admin DSL
* inherited_resources
* nested_form
And being familiar with these may also help:
* ransack
* simple_form
* kaminari


<h2>First application with basepack</h2>
TODO version of RAILS
TODO in which person should I write it

In this tutorial we will be creating issue tracking application. But first of all, let's create a new rails application
```console
rails new issue_tracker
```

Now we can add basepack to Gemfile.
```ruby
gem 'basepack'
```

This creates a new generator for installing basepack so let's run it:
```console
rails g basepack:install
```
TODO: what if I answer no to these questions

The generator notices absence of devise and cancan and offers installing them as well. Then you can use application.html.haml template from rails_admin.


 First of all, let's generate a Project scaffold.
Looks a way nicer than Rails scaffolding.
Now lepidlo will take over scaffolding
```
rails g scaffold Project name description:text start:date end:date user:belongs_to
```
generated files

Screenshots - TODO(ENGLISH)
It includes pagination, searching

And generated code looks differently as well Comparision of Rails scaffold and basepack scaffold. 
Let's take a look at that buety. But it would be nicer without id, created_at, updated_at columns

Add validation
Data types


<h3>Project's issues</h3>
<!-- Show where we are going  -->
Project has many issues. So we want to display issues on project show page.
So let's repeat the same process for Issue and create scaffold for it.

Just add the field and association is detected.

If there were a lot of projects it will be better not to display tasks which already ended. 

Let's display it as a nested resource.

We need to configure controllers

Options
Simple



Track who created project
Show user email instead of object -> name, to_label

Let's create issue
rails g scaffold Issue name description project:belongs_to user:belongs_to
rake db:migrate
let's show it as a nested resource and configure showed fields and in edit also (project belongs_to works)
issue - user who created it
